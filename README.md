# BluetickAssessment

This project includes a Django backend and a React frontend for a simple login and book listing application.

## Backend Files

1. `views.py`: Contains the Django views for handling login and book listing functionality using Django REST 
2. `models.py`: Defines the Django models for the application's data, including the `Book` model for storing book details.
3. `urls.py`: Contains the URL patterns for routing requests to the appropriate views.

## Frontend Files

1. `Login.js`: React component for the login page. It handles user input, form submission, and communicates with the backend API for authentication.
2. `Home.js`: React component for the home page. It displays a list of books retrieved from the backend and allows the user to log out.

## Additional Files

1. `style.css`: CSS styles for the frontend components.
2. `axios`: JavaScript library for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
3. `universal-cookie`: Library for working with cookies in JavaScript.
4. `validator`: Library for email validation in JavaScript.
